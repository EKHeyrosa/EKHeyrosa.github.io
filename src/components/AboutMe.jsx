                    Hello! My name is Elijah Kent Heyrosa, and I’m a passionate web developer based 
                    in Canada. Currently, I’m a student at the New Brunswick Community College, 
                    nearing graduation and excited to embark on the next chapter of my career. <br /> <br />
                    
                    Over the course of my studies, I’ve gained valuable experience working with a 
                    diverse array of programming languages, including C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, 
                    and TypeScript, as well as frameworks such as AngularJS, ASP.NET Core, Spring 
                    Boot, and ReactJS. My journey has also involved working with databases like 
                    SSMS, MySQL, and MongoDB, broadening my technical expertise. <br /><br />

                    Beyond technical skills, I’ve learned what it takes to excel as a web 
                    developer: collaborating effectively within teams, honing strong communication 
                    skills, managing time and tasks efficiently, and solving complex problems with 
                    creativity and focus. <br /><br />

                    My passion for web development began in high school when I discovered 
                    programming. I’ve always loved creating, and programming became the perfect 
                    outlet for my creativity. It ignited my fascination with cutting-edge 
                    technologies and fueled my curiosity to learn how to leverage them in 
                    meaningful ways. I thrive on continuously expanding my knowledge and applying 
                    that drive to create impactful solutions through my work.
