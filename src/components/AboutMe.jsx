                    Hello! My name is Elijah Kent Heyrosa, and I'm a passionate web developer based in Canada. 
                    I graduated from the New Brunswick Community College in June 2025, and I'm excited to continue 
                    building my career in the tech industry.

                <p className="about-text">
                    Throughout my studies and project experience, I've worked extensively with programming languages 
                    such as C#, Java, PHP, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with frameworks like AngularJS, ASP.NET Core, 
                    Spring Boot, and ReactJS. I've also gained practical experience working with databases including SSMS, 
                    MySQL, and MongoDB, giving me a strong full-stack foundation.

                    In addition to technical skills, I've developed a wide range of transferable soft skills that support my 
                    work as a developer, including:

                    My passion for web development began in high school, where I first discovered programming. 
                    Creating things from scratch sparked my curiosity and inspired me to explore how technology can 
                    be used to build meaningful, user-focused solutions. That passion continues to drive me today as I 
                    grow, learn, and make an impact through my work.
